HIRESYNC
A web application that helps candidates take technical assessments using AI assistance. The goal is to have candidates take assessment while being provided smart hints, explanations, and guided feedback.
🚀 Features
Simple user flow for taking assessments
AI-assistance
Basic candidate and recruiter dashboards
Recruiters can upload or post assessments
Candidates can attempt assessments with guided support
Clean, minimal UI wireframes 
Tech Stack
Frontend: React 
Backend: MongoDB
Styling: TailwindCSS

How It Works
Candidates log in → choose or start an assessment → AI provides optional hints and breakdowns.
Recruiters log in → create assessments → review candidate attempts.
The system remains assistive only, not a full exam-taking bot.
